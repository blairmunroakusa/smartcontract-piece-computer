# Interlock Smart Contracts

Welcome! This repo hosts development of all smart contracts that actualize our **token model** and **DeSec** infrastructure. It exists to be transparent about our contract development.

Contracts are written in **ink!** on the Aleph Zero blockchain. These contracts are contained within the `alephzero-contracts` directory. This directory contains an NFT mint that we are using to license our Discord security bot called **Bouncer**, and additionally grant membership for VIP Interlockers. It also contains `ilockmvp` which is the collection of PSP22 token and interlocker rewards functionality, comprising the heart of Interlock blockchain activity. Alongside these two directories is one dedicated to client-side scripts.

Before our move to Aleph Zero, we were developing for an Ethereum-Wormhole-Solana blockchain stack. All this work is available in `ARCHIVE`, for transparency and future reference.

We have enabled [discussions](https://github.com/interlock-network/INTR-smartcontracts/discussions) and will be open to feedback throughout the development process. Please feel free to chime in on a discussion or [issue](https://github.com/interlock-network/INTR-smartcontracts/issues), or reach out directly to blockchain engineer @blairmunroakusa on TG, Discord, or Github if you have anything direct.

Likewise, feel free to comment on issues as they come up. We use an org-wide labeling system, but will have specific labels for this repository to denote contract type, client tooling, etc.

Enjoy!
